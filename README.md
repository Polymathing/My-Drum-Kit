Project created with HTML + CSS + JS. The purpose here was to practice the application of methods in JS (making use of constructor functions) and to get a better grasp of callbacks.

PS:
_Now you can make some noise, or just do the "ba dum tss!" when a friend tells you a poor joke. Thank me later. ðŸ˜„_
